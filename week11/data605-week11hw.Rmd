## Question 1
![](./pics/1.png)

```{r}
data("cars")
```


Generate Model

```{r}
model <- lm(dist ~ ., data = cars)
summary(model)
```

Evaluation
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))

plot(model)
hist(model$residuals)
qqnorm(model$residuals)
qqline(model$residuals)
```

The residuals of the model are slightly skewed right but apporximately normal. The normal plot shows residuals that follow a normal approximation. The model only has an R^2 of .6438 which means that the speed only accounts for ~64% of the variation when it comes to stopping distance. A better model would likely include more features.
